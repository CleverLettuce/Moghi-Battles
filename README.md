# Moghi Battles

Moghi Battles is a prototype of a MOBA game developed as a part of my Bachelor's Thesis. The game fetures two heroes with different skills and two maps. The game client is made in Unity while the login server is made in Spring. Photon Cloud service is used as lobby and game server. This repository doesn't contain any third-party assets used in the development of the game, only the implementation of the login server and C# scripts written by me.

<b>Summary:</b><br>
MOBA games are one of the most popular video game genres. As a part of this work, a MOBA game prototype called „Moghi Battles“ was implemented. The game retains most of the main features of the modern MOBA games such as heroes, skills, team competition, varied maps and defensive structures. One feature that isn't present are computer controlled units also known as „creeps“. The game client is implemented using a game engine called Unity and Photon Unity Networking framework. The data server is implemented using Spring Framework. In addition to the implementation of the game, the work consists of a theoretical part in which the architecture and synchronization mechanisms of network games are discussed.

My supervisor and I also wrote a paper based on the thesis. The article is published in the [Proceedings of 40th Jubilee International Convention MIPRO 2017, (pp. 1762-1767)]{http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/proceedings/mipro_2017_proceedings.pdf} and is also available [here (direct link)]{docs.mipro-proceedings.com/sp/sp_05_4354.pdf} or here [(IEEE Xplore link)]{ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7973661}.
